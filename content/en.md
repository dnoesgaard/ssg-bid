BID: Biodiversity Information for Development
===================

Biodiversity Information for Development (BID) is a multi-year, €3.9 million programme funded by the [European Union](http://europa.eu) and led by [GBIF](http://gbif.org)—the Global Biodiversity Information Facility—with the aim of increasing the amount of biodiversity information available for use in scientific research and policymaking in the [‘ACP’ nations of sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific](http://www.acp.int/content/secretariat-acp).

> GBIF is now inviting calls for proposals in Sub-Saharan Africa—[download the template](/raw/BID-Concept-Note-Template-Africa-2017.docx) and [learn all the details]](../en/calls/africa-2017/introduction)

The first phase of project funding from BID provided [nearly €1 million to 23 projects in sub-Saharan Africa](http://www.gbif.org/newsroom/news/first-bid-grants-for-africa). Recipients include 34 organizations from 20 African countries, whose projects earned selection by an international panel from an initial pool of 143 initial proposals. [See all the projects](http://www.gbif.org/programme/bid/all-projects).

Selected applicants to the recent calls for proposals from the Caribbean and Pacific have already received an invitation to submit full proposals in late February. Following a final review and selection by the panels, funded projects are expected to start in April 2017.
