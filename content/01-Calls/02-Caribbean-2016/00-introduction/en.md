## Survey for data holders and decision makers in the Caribbean

GBIF is seeking input from two stakeholder groups critical to the long-term success of the BID programme: data holders and decision makers. 

*NOTE*: All applicants seeking funding under this call for proposals are required to complete the appropriate survey.

**Data holders** need resources and incentives to distribute the many types of information that they steward.
