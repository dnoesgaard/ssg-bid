# National grants

_Sub-Saharan Africa, 2017_

_**Reminder for existing BID grant recipients**: The maximum amount that any single applicant may receive from the BID programme is €60,000. The combined total received by any applicant under all rounds of BID calls cannot exceed this limit._

National grants under the BID programme seek to establish or strengthen national biodiversity information facilities and to increase the biodiversity data available about the country to respond to national priorities.

These guidelines are available in English, Portuguese and French; the English version is the authoritative version. They accompany the BID [call for proposals](http://www.gbif.org/newsroom/news/bid-africa-call-for-proposals-2017) and [concept note template](/raw/BID-Concept-Note-Template-Africa-2017.docx). General questions may be sent to [BID@gbif.org](mailto:BID@gbif.org).

## Biodiversity information facilities

Many different stakeholder groups in a given country or organization may be involved in collecting, organizing and using data on biodiversity. These different groups often do not fully benefit from one another’s efforts, either failing to discover all existing information or duplicating effort by spending time on the same tasks. 

Within the GBIF network, the group that coordinates national activities with the goal of ensuring effective cooperation and combination of resources and information is a ‘biodiversity information facility’. Using tools and techniques developed and applied by formal GBIF members, these groups sustain key relationships and common solutions for managing and accessing data.

GBIF exists to support its member states and organizations—or, more formally, its Participants—to establish these networks. By signing the GBIF [Memorandum of Understanding](http://www.gbif.org/resource/80661), GBIF Participants commit to set up a Participant node that coordinates a biodiversity information facility. More information on biodiversity information facilities is available in the guide, [*Establishing an Effective GBIF Participant Node*](http://www.gbif.org/resource/80925) (which also available in [French](http://www.gbif.org/resource/82147), [Portuguese](http://www.gbif.org/resource/82231) and [Spanish](http://www.gbif.org/resource/82186).

## Objectives

The objectives of the BID national biodiversity data mobilization grants are to:
+ Establish or strengthen national biodiversity information facilities
+ Increase available biodiversity data, within and beyond the grant period
+ Apply biodiversity data in response to national priorities

The overall BID programme targets two key outcomes:
1. Enhanced capacity for effective mobilization and use of biodiversity information
2. Enhanced availability of information resources and best practice guidance for mobilization and application of biodiversity information for key policy needs

## Evaluation criteria

The selection panel will base its assessment of applications on the following criteria:

1. Alignment of the project with BID objectives and priorities.
2. Alignment of the project with clearly stated needs for biodiversity information and capacity development within the proposal.
3. The project’s complementary contributions to regional data needs.
4. Likelihood that the project will provide examples of best practice in the application of biodiversity information in decision-making.
5. Quantity, quality and relevance of the biodiversity data proposed for mobilization, with preference given to projects that mobilize biodiversity data relating to protected areas, threatened species and invasive alien species.
6. Level of national support and cost-effectiveness of the proposed actions; the balance between the level of funding requested from BID and the cofunding contributed by the project partners.
7. Anticipated value of the project deliverables to both the national context and the broader GBIF community.
8. Choice and diversity of project partners, with preference given to projects that have the confirmed involvement of a diverse network of data holders and data users.

**NOTE**: Full proposals will also assess: 

+ Project management skills of coordinating team based on previous experience
+ Quality of project design and risk assessment
+ Monitoring and evaluation plans
+ Sustainability plan

-----------

## Project duration

Selected projects may begin their activities on 1 October 2017

Projects may run for up to **fifteen (15) months** and must end by 31 December 2018, followed by a final three-month reporting and evaluation period ending 31 March 2019. 

Grantees must complete all project activities by 31 December 2018.

-----------

## Funding

Up to €40,000 per national grant. **The total maximum amount of funding that any single institution may receive during the whole BID programme is €60,000.**

-----------

## National grant activity types

National grants should include at least one activity contributing to the following component categories. GBIF highly encourages the prioritization of activities that mobilize biodiversity data. Each category below includes a non-exclusive list of possible types of activity. It is important that activities are implemented within the 15-month project period.

**1. Capacity enhancement of national biodiversity information facilities**
+ Assessing biodiversity data holdings and user needs (with assessment method description)
+ Developing a strategic plan for the biodiversity information facility
+ Organizing national stakeholders’ workshops to engage the community of biodiversity data holders and users
+ Formalizing partnerships through institutional agreements, data sharing policies and public endorsement of mobilization strategies
+ Establishing governance structures for the biodiversity information facilities (including representation from ministries, key institutions holding or using biodiversity data, etc.)
+ Setting up an infrastructure for the biodiversity information facility to support data publishing and management
+ Training stakeholders on data mobilization and management, for example, through workshops to share the knowledge gained through attending the two BID capacity enhancement workshops

**2. Activities to mobilize biodiversity data**
+ Compiling inventories of biodiversity data holdings (for example, implementing metadata catalogues)
+ Digitizing and publishing natural history collections and biodiversity information from literature
+ Mobilizing species occurrence and sample-based data from observation networks and monitoring systems, such as invasive alien species, Red Listed species or endemic species
+ Validating and publishing regional, national and local species checklists, invasive species lists or threatened species lists
+ Preparing [data papers](http://www.gbif.org/publishing-data/data-papers) to improve the reusability of the mobilized biodiversity data

**3. Integrating biodiversity information into policy and decision-making processes**
+ Leading surveys or workshops to understand the biodiversity data requirements for specific use cases.
+ Setting up user groups to guide project implementation on identified priority themes, such as agrobiodiversity, urban biodiversity and protected areas.
+ Directing workshops and advocacy actions that promote the use of openly accessible data, for example, in national-level biodiversity reporting.
+ Hosting workshops on data analysis techniques.
+ Applying biodiversity data in decision-making processes.
+ Documenting use cases and sharing them with partners in the region.

## General recommendations for preparing concept notes

+ **Ensure that your project meets the eligibility criteria and aligns well with the overall objectives for the programme**. Consider the evaluation criteria used by the evaluation panel to assess your proposal.
+ **Be brief**. Try to provide the shortest responses possible and only add background information if really needed, using links to external resources rather than long explanations.
+ **Prepare your submissions in English**. The evaluation panel will use English as their working language and therefore applicants are requested to make submissions in English. Remember that if you have particular difficulties with this requirement, contact [BID@gbif.org](mailto:BID@gbif.org) for support as early as possible, and **before 27 March 2017**.
+ **Review the FAQ**. [This page](../faq) will be updated throughout the project application period. Send any unanswered questions to [BID@gbif.org](mailto:BID@gbif.org). 
+ **Submit as early as possible to avoid problems**. Early submission will give a chance for some follow-up to resolve any issues that arise ahead of the deadline. The deadline for submissions is a hard deadline, and projects received late or incomplete will not be reviewed by the evaluation panel.
