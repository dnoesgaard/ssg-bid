# Small grants

_Sub-Saharan Africa, 2017_

_**Reminder for existing BID grant recipients**: The maximum amount that any single applicant may receive from the BID programme is €60,000. The combined total received by any applicant under all rounds of BID calls cannot exceed this limit._

Small grants under the BID programme seek to mobilize biodiversity data relevant for biodiversity conservation priorities.

-----------------------

## Submission procedure

The deadline for submitting initial concept notes from sub-Saharan Africa was 20 November 2015. GBIF and the BID evaluation panel have provided feedback and recommendations to applicants invited to prepare full proposals.

**Applications must be submitted in English and by using the appropriate template**.

Applications received late or incomplete will not be reviewed by the evaluation panel. 

-----------------------

## Objectives

The objectives of the BID small biodiversity data mobilization grants are to:
+ Increase available biodiversity data, within and beyond the grant period
+ Apply biodiversity data in response to conservation priorities

The overall BID programme targets two key outcomes:
1. Enhanced capacity for effective mobilization and use of biodiversity information
2. Enhanced availability of information resources and best practice guidance for mobilization and application of biodiversity information for key policy needs
 
-----------------------

## Key documents

+ [Proposal template](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-Small-Grant-Template_0.doc)
+ [First Call For Proposals](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID%20Call%20For%20Proposals%20Africa.pdf)
+ [First Call for Proposals - Annex A](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_project/files/BID-call-for-proposals-Annex-A.pdf) 
+ [Africa Rising declaration](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_event/files/AfricaRising-Declaration-EN.pdf)
 
-----------------------

## Evaluation criteria

Proposals will be assessed using the following criteria:

1. Alignment of the project with BID objectives and priorities.
2. Alignment of the project with clearly stated needs for biodiversity information and capacity development within the proposal.
3. The project’s complementary contributions to regional data needs, including those stated in the [Africa Rising declaration and action plan](http://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_event/files/AfricaRising-Declaration-EN.pdf).
4. Demonstrated success and past experience delivering similar projects.
5. Likelihood that the project will provide examples of best practice in the application of biodiversity information in decision-making.
6. Quantity, quality and relevance of the biodiversity data proposed for mobilization, with preference given to projects that mobilize biodiversity data relating to protected areas, threatened species and invasive alien species.
7. Strength of the plans to develop capacity that will contribute to the sustainability of the actions.
8. Level of institutional support and cost effectiveness of the proposed actions; the balance between the level of funding requested from BID and the cofunding contributed by the partners.
9. Anticipated value of the project deliverables to both the national context and the broader GBIF community.
10. Quality of project design and risk assessment; monitoring and evaluation plans will be assessed in the full proposals

-----------------------

## Project duration

Selected projects may begin their activities in June 2016, with project activity continuing for up to one year, and with a final six-month reporting and evaluation period (ending December 2017). All projects must end by 31 December 2017.
 
-----------------------

## Funding

Up to €5,000 per small grant. During the course of the BID programme, the maximum total project funding that any single applicant can receive is €60,000.
 
 
### Small grant activity types

There are two categories of eligible activity types for small grants, each presented with a non-exclusive list of the types of possible types of activity. Small grants must include activities in the first category and may also include activities in the second category.

1. Activities to mobilize biodiversity data relevant to protected areas, invasive alien species and/or threatened species:
+ Compiling inventories of biodiversity data holdings (for example, implementing metadata catalogues).
+ Digitizing and publishing natural history collections and biodiversity information from literature.
+ Mobilizing species occurrence and sample-based data from observation networks and monitoring systems, such as invasive alien species, Red Listed species or endemic species.
+ Validating and publishing regional, national and local species checklists, invasive species lists or threatened species lists.
+ Preparing [data papers](http://www.gbif.org/publishing-data/data-papers) to improve the reusability of the mobilized biodiversity data.

2. Integrating biodiversity information into policy and decision-making processes:
+ Leading surveys or workshops to understand the biodiversity data requirements for specific use cases
+ Setting up user groups to guide project implementation on identified priority themes, such as agrobiodiversity, urban biodiversity and protected areas
+ Directing workshops and advocacy actions that promote the use of openly accessible data, for example, in national-level biodiversity reporting
+ Hosting workshops on data analysis techniques
+ Applying biodiversity data in decision-making processes
+ Documenting use cases and sharing them with partners in the region
