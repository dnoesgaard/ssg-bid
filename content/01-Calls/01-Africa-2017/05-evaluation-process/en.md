# Proposal evaluation and selection process

The call for proposals is a two-stage process consisting of a first round of concept notes and a second round of full proposals.

## Evaluation of concept notes 

1. Each concept note undergoes an eligibility check to ensure the project compliance with the eligibility rules stated in the published call for proposals. 
2. Three different assessors—some with internal experience of the GBIF network and some with expertise in biodiversity research and management in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) regions—assess eligible concept notes and give recommendations to an evaluation panel.  
3. The evaluation panel selects projects invited to submit a full proposal based on input provided by the assessors but also on other criteria such as to ensure reaching the objectives and achievements envisioned by BID. These may include:
    + Geographical and thematic representation
    + Proposals to pair separate concept note proposals
    + Recommendations for the division of funds between the BID grant categories
    + Suggested alterations to the budgets of concept notes
    + Recommendations for the development of full proposals

## Evaluation of project full proposals

1. Each project full proposal undergoes an eligibility check to ensure the project compliance with the eligibility rules stated in the published call for proposals.
2. Three different assessors—including some with internal experience of the GBIF network and some with expertise in biodiversity research and management in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) regions—assess eligible project full proposals and give recommendations to the Evaluation panel.  
3. An evaluation panel makes the final selection of the project full proposals to be funded under the BID programme, based on input provided by the assessors but also on other criteria such as to ensure reaching the objectives and achievements envisioned by BID. These may include:
    + Geographical and thematic representation
    + Recommendations for the division of funds between the BID grant categories
