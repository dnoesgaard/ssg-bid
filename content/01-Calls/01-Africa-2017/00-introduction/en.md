# Call for proposals

_Sub-Saharan Africa, 2017_

_**Reminder for existing BID grant recipients**: The maximum amount that any single applicant may receive from the BID programme is €60,000. The combined total received by any applicant under all rounds of BID calls cannot exceed this limit._

GBIF invites the submission of concept notes for project funding from sub-Saharan Africa through [Biodiversity Information for Development (BID)](http://www.gbif.org/bid), a programme funded by the [European Union](http://europa.eu). The deadline for submissions is **9 April 2017**, midnight CET / 2300 UTC/GMT. 

The total potential funding assigned to this call is €400,000, and applicants successful in this round will receive invitations to submit full proposals in May 2017. 

This call, like those that preceded it, seeks to support projects from sub-Saharan Africa that:
+ Mobilize biodiversity data relating to protected areas, threatened species, and invasive alien species
+ Use and extend best practices for digitizing natural history collections and mobilizing other biodiversity data
+ Apply biodiversity data in support of decision-making and research
+ Develop lasting national, regional or thematic networks to support ongoing data sharing and reuse

The call offers support for two grant types:
+ [**National grants**](../national-grants) that establish or strengthen [national biodiversity information facilities](http://www.gbif.org/resource/80925) and to increase the biodiversity data available about the country to respond to national priorities. Up to €40,000 will be made available per national grant.
+ [**Small grants**](../small-grants) that mobilize biodiversity data relevant for biodiversity conservation priorities, with a maximum funding of €20,000.

### Application process and timeline

A panel of international experts with experience in the region will evaluate applications through a competitive two-stage process.
+ Applicants must submit **initial concept notes** using the [provided template**](/raw/BID-Concept-Note-Template-Africa-2017.docx) by 9 April 2017.
+ Based on the panels’ recommendations, GBIF will invite a select group of applicants to prepare **full proposals**, expected to be due in July 2017.
+ Following the panel’s final review and selection, funded projects will start in October 2017. GBIF expects to announce these projects publicly by November 2017.
