The deadline for submitting initial concept notes from sub-Saharan Africa was 20 November 2015. GBIF and its evaluation panel invited a selected number of applicants to submit full proposals in February 2016 and expect to announce project selections in April 2016.

This call supports projects from sub-Saharan Africa that:
+ Mobilize biodiversity data relating to protected areas, threatened species, and invasive alien species
+ Use and extend best practices for digitizing natural history collections and mobilizing other biodiversity data
+ Apply biodiversity data in support of decision-making and research
+ Develop lasting national, regional or thematic networks to support ongoing data sharing and reuse

The call offers support for three grant types
+ [Regional grants](../regional-grants)
+ [National grants](../national-grants)
+ [Small grants](../small-grants)

A second and final call for proposals to support countries in sub-Saharan Africa is planned for 2017.
